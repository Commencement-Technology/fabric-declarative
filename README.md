# Native declarative frameworks in bare React Native projects
This repository is an example of how you can use Jetpack Compose
and SwiftUI in your bare (non-framework) React Native projects with new architecture enabled.
This repository is an addition to my articles on Medium:
1. [React Native Fabric component using SwiftUI](https://medium.com/@someSOAP/react-native-fabric-component-using-swiftui-40d692c1baaa)
2. [React Native Fabric component using Jetpack Compose](https://medium.com/@someSOAP/react-native-fabric-component-using-jetpack-compose-97328f725fb0)

## Content
This repository contains three branches - ios and android,
which contains code only for corresponding platform,
and main branch with all code merged.
Each commit in each branch relates to specific step from the articles.
